# Managing a remote Scrum Team across Time Zones and Languages: Tips and Strategies for Success

## But, what is Scrum?

[**Scrum**](https://www.scrum.org/) is a popular **agile framework** that is commonly used in technology teams to manage and complete complex projects.

It is based on the principles of **transparency**, **inspection**, and **adaptation**, and it emphasizes the importance of delivering working software to **stakeholders regularly**.

> One of the key features of **Scrum** is the use of **short development cycles**, known as **sprints**, which typically last between **one and four weeks**.

During each sprint, the team works to complete a set of predetermined tasks, known as user stories, which are prioritized in a backlog.

## How to implement SCRUM

To implement **Scrum**, you will need to assemble a **cross-functional team of individuals who are responsible for the entire development process**, from planning to testing to deployment.

This team, **known as the Scrum team**, should include:

* a **Scrum Master**, who is responsible for facilitating the process and ensuring that the team adheres to Scrum principles,
    
* and a **Product Owner**, who is responsible for prioritizing the user stories and representing the needs of the stakeholders.
    

One of the key challenges in implementing **Scrum** is determining how much work the team can reasonably complete during each sprint. This is where the concept of "**points**" comes in.

> **Points** are used to estimate the relative size and complexity of each user story, and they are typically assigned using a technique called "**relative estimation**," in which the team compares the size and complexity of each user story to a reference user story that has already been assigned a point value.

**To organize the work during a sprint**, the team will need to hold **daily stand-up meetings**, known as **Scrum meetings**, in which each team member provides a brief update on their progress and any challenges they are facing.

The team will also need to hold a **sprint planning meeting** at the beginning of each sprint to determine which user stories will be completed during the sprint, and a **sprint review or demo meeting** at the end of the sprint to demonstrate the completed work to the stakeholders.

## Scrum Phases

The different phases of a Scrum project include:

1. **Sprint planning**: During this phase, the team determines which user stories will be completed during the sprint and creates a plan for completing them.
    
2. **Daily Scrum meetings**: These meetings are held each day during the sprint and provide an opportunity for team members to share their progress and challenges.
    
3. **Sprint execution**: This is the phase in which the team works to complete the user stories that have been prioritized for the sprint.
    
4. **Sprint review**: At the end of the sprint, the team demonstrates the completed work to the stakeholders and discusses what was learned during the sprint.
    
5. **Sprint retrospective**: This is a meeting in which the team reflects on their process and identifies areas for improvement.
    

By implementing Scrum and following these best practices, technology teams can improve their efficiency and deliver high-quality products to stakeholders regularly.

## Scrum Daily meetings

During these daily meetings, **each team member** will share what was accomplished the previous day, and which blockers did found (if they exist).

Then, which would be the next tasks to accomplish today?

That will bring to the team a clear idea of the team's status.

> * **What did I accomplish yesterday**
>     
> * **What blockers or problems did I find yesterday**
>     
> * **What are the tasks to accomplish today**
>     

## Key benefits of Scrum

One of the key benefits of using the **Scrum** framework is that it allows teams to respond quickly to change and adapt to new requirements as they emerge. This is because the framework is based on the principles of transparency, inspection, and adaptation, which encourage teams to regularly assess their progress and make adjustments as needed.

Another **benefit** of **Scrum** is that it promotes **collaboration** and **teamwork**. By bringing all team members together to work on a common set of goals, Scrum encourages the sharing of ideas and knowledge, and it helps to build strong, cohesive teams.

> In addition to these benefits, **Scrum** also helps to **improve communication and transparency** within the team.
> 
> The **regular stand-up meetings**, **sprint planning sessions**, and **sprint reviews** provide opportunities for team members to share their progress and challenges, which can help to **identify** and **resolve issues** more quickly.
> 
> Finally, **Scrum** can help teams to **deliver high-quality products more efficiently**.
> 
> By breaking down **large**, **complex projects** into **smaller**, more manageable chunks and focusing on **delivering** working software regularly, teams can avoid the delays and inefficiencies that can often plague traditional development processes.

The Scrum framework is a powerful tool for managing complex projects in technology teams. By using Scrum, teams can respond quickly to change, collaborate effectively, improve communication and transparency, and deliver high-quality products more efficiently. If you are considering implementing Scrum in your team, it is important to fully understand the framework and the best practices for using it and to be prepared to adapt and adjust as needed.

## Managing a team across 5 different timezones

During 3 years I was managing a Scrum Team of up to 6 across 4 different timezones when I was working at [Fishfishme](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fishfishme):

* India (UTC -5)
    
* Dubai (UTC -4)
    
* Egypt (UTC -2)
    
* Spain (UTC -1)
    
* San Diego (UTC +8)
    

And I faced many of the problems that I shared in this post.

## Remote teams

Managing a Scrum team remotely can present some unique challenges, but with the right tools and processes in place, it is possible to achieve the same level of productivity and success as with a co-located team. Here are a few tips for effectively implementing Scrum on a remote team:

1. **Use the right tools**: To facilitate communication and collaboration, it is important to have the right tools in place. This might include video conferencing software for meetings, project management tools to track progress and prioritize tasks, and collaboration tools to share documents and collaborate on projects.
    
2. **Set clear expectations**: When working remotely, it can be easy for team members to lose sight of their responsibilities and priorities. To avoid this, it is important to set clear expectations for communication, availability, and project delivery.
    
3. **Over-communicate**: In a remote environment, it is especially important to ensure that team members are in constant communication with one another. This might include holding daily stand-up meetings, using chat tools to keep in touch throughout the day, and using video conferencing software to hold regular meetings.
    
4. **Use asynchronous communication**: While real-time communication is important, it is not always possible or necessary. To ensure that team members have time to focus on their work, it is also important to use asynchronous communication tools such as email and project management software to keep track of progress and provide updates.
    
5. **Be flexible**: When working remotely, team members may have different schedules and time zones, and it is important to be flexible and accommodate these differences. This might include adjusting meeting times or allowing team members to work on their schedules as long as they are meeting their deadlines.
    

You can effectively implement **Scrum** with these tips on a remote team and achieve the same level of success as with a co-located team.

> Another **key** aspect of managing a **Scrum** team remotely is **building trust** and fostering a **sense of community**.

This is especially important when team members are not physically together and may not have the same opportunities to interact and build relationships. Here are a few strategies for building trust and community on a remote **Scrum** team:

1. **Get to know each other**: Take the time to get to know your team members personally, including their interests, hobbies, and goals. This can help to build a sense of connection and understanding among team members.
    
2. **Encourage open communication**: Encourage team members to share their thoughts, ideas, and concerns openly and honestly. This can help to build trust and ensure that everyone feels heard and valued.
    
3. **Foster a positive culture**: Create a positive and supportive culture that encourages collaboration, learning, and personal growth. This can help to build a sense of community and ensure that team members feel motivated and engaged.
    
4. **Use video conferencing**: Whenever possible, use video conferencing to hold meetings and discussions. This can help to build a sense of connection and facilitate more effective communication.
    

This way, you can help to build trust and foster a sense of community on your remote **Scrum** team, which can improve team performance and overall success.

In addition to the tips and strategies mentioned above, there are a few other best practices that can help to ensure the success of a remote Scrum team:

1. **Set clear goals and priorities**: Clearly define the goals and priorities for each sprint and make sure that team members understand their roles and responsibilities. This can help to ensure that everyone is working towards the same objectives and that there is no confusion about what needs to be done.
    
2. **Establish a consistent process**: Establish a consistent process for completing tasks and delivering work, and make sure that all team members are familiar with it. This can help to streamline the development process and ensure that work is delivered consistently and on time.
    
3. **Encourage self-management**: Encourage team members to take ownership of their work and manage their own time and tasks. This can help to build trust and foster a sense of responsibility among team members.
    

That way can help you to ensure the success of your remote **Scrum** team and deliver high-quality products to stakeholders regularly.

## Time zones and languages

Managing a **Scrum** team that spans multiple time zones and languages can present some unique challenges, but it is possible to overcome these challenges and achieve success.

Here are a few tips for effectively managing a **Scrum** team with diverse time zones and languages:

1. **Use a project management tool**: A project management tool can help to keep team members organized and on track, regardless of their location or language. This can provide a clear view of the project's progress and ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals.
    
2. **Use video conferencing**: Video conferencing is an effective way to hold meetings and discussions with team members in different time zones and languages. This can help to facilitate better communication and collaboration, and it can help to build a sense of connection among team members.
    
3. **Use translation tools**: If team members speak different languages, it is important to use translation tools to facilitate communication. This can help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and able to understand one another.
    
4. **Set clear expectations**: When working with team members in different time zones, it is important to set clear expectations for communication and availability. This can help to ensure that everyone can collaborate effectively and meet deadlines.
    

With these tips, you can effectively manage a Scrum team with diverse time zones and languages and achieve success. It is also important to be flexible and adaptable, as the needs of the team may change over time.
